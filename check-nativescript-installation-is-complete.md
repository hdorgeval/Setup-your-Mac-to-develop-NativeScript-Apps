# Check NativeScript Installation is complete {#check-nativescript-installation-is-complete}

Checking if you environment is setup to develop NativeScript apps is very easy.

Open a Terminal Window and type:

```
tns doctor
```

If the installation is OK you will receive this response:

```
Verifying CocoaPods. This may take more than a minute, please be patient.
Your components are up-to-date.

No issues were detected.
```

If some components are missing from the android SDK or from the JDK, you will receive an error message

If you see one of these messages, go to the JDK and Android sections to solve this issue.
