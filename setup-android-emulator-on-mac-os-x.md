# Setup Android Emulator on Mac OS X

The purpose of this section is to guide you to create in your development environment an Android emulator.

Android emulators are managed through a UI called AVD Manager

AVD Manager has a nice interface when started from Android Studio.

Start Android Studio app, then create a blank project.

Go to the Tools menu -&gt; :Android -&gt; AVD Manager:

Click on the launch button to launch the newly created AVD in the emulator.  
Notice in the Run Window of Android Studio the command line used to start the device:

```
/Users/HDO/Library/Android/sdk/tools/emulator -netdelay none -netspeed full -avd Nexus_5_API_25
```

which can be shortened to :

```
$ANDROID_HOME/tools/emulator -netdelay none -netspeed full -avd Nexus_5_API_25
```

Stop the emulator started by Android Studio. Open the Terminal app and type the following command:

```
$ANDROID_HOME/tools/emulator -netdelay none -netspeed full -avd Nexus_5_API_25
```
This should start the emulator with the selected AVD.
