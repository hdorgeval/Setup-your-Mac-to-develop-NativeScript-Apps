### Convert the project folder into a package

By default Visual Studio Code will see any files in the folder as unrelated files.  
To process your folder and any file within that folder as a project entity, Visual Studio Code needs specific information.

To do this, you need to transform your project folder into a package folder. From there you will be able to manage every dependencies in your project.  
You will be able to download and reference into your project folder any third-party module you need to develop your App.

Go to the Terminal Window you have opened in the previous section and type the following commands:

```
pwd
npm init --yes
```

the pwd command will give you your current working directory. Be sure this current directory is your project's directory.
